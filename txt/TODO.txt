list of testers
FB ask for volunteers publicly, or privately?
Who has an iPad?
bionoid? inclement? mmammel?

Great :) You have an iPad? I will need your email address to send a TestFlight invite. Once you get that and register your device, I need to load that into a "profile" and then build a version of my app with that profile in it, and upload it to TestFlight again.

Finishing off before wide public release
----------------------------------------
Openings Book: request permission from Rainwolf?
Remove Human Player defaults

Improve strength
----------------
Openings book - Manual Tweak? Filter out worst moves
optimise
search alg.
- iterative deepening
- chokes: study move number chosen
#- killer heuristic? history heuristic? Not helping.
utility function
- fukami
- diagonal versus straight weighting?
#- different utility for different spacings of same length lines
- search order inc line subtype knowledge
- parallel lines
- centeredness
- hammer formation
- How to gauge how many moves need to be searched at a particular level? For budget search etc.
- Length level for search stats; yet another PF that uses it (count levels of lengths used as best, relative to the first level tried)
- Go back moves in search to avoid cloning
- 0. m 1. capture m 2. m Must be better than 0. m 1. (anything else)
  (where m is an opponent move, and 2. m is the best line of play for P2)
  If best move (move 2) == same as two moves ago: # after all move 2s searched
      don't need to search any non-captures for move 1.
- Create a list of instructive lost games
- Optimise Openings DB creation

Wendy's suggestions (iOS)
-------------------
AI goes slower or stops early in game
Take back and play not possible (iOS? intermittent?)
Slow to get game screen when AI makes slow first move
# Can only create one AI player
# Main title colour is too much like settings title colour
# Find same size, level courier font

Noel's suggestions
------------------
Add Kivy request for Text underline
Courier for button names?
