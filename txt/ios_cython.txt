Hi all

I am having trouble getting my cython extensions on to my new iPad.
I just found this blog, which should help, but I still have some conceptual questions.
http://shadowmint.blogspot.com.au/2013/10/kivy-cython-extensions-and-ios.html

Is there a reason why the .pyx files cannot be cythonized and compiled by the tools/populate-project.sh script, and then built from XCode?

Why do I get the error:
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/Cython/Compiler/Main.py", line 17, in <module>
    from Scanning import PyrexScanner, FileSourceDescriptor
ImportError: dynamic module does not define init function (initScanning)
... when I attempt to build my extensions via XCode?

I have several .py files that I cythonize when I build and test on OS X. I'd like to avoid having to move them out of my source tree and/or have them build into separate python package(s). Is this possible?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions, this has been very time consuming...
Bruce
