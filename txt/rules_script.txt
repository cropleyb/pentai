Pente is played on the intersections, not in the squares.
Black always goes first.
In the standard and tournament versions, the first move must be in the centre.
The first player to get five or more stones in a continuous straight line wins.
Stones can be placed on any empty intersection, including edges and corners.
Winning lines can also be diagonal.

Pairs of stones may be taken by placing a stone at each end of the pair.
Diagonal captures are also possible.
There are several variations that don't cause a capture.
A single stone cannot be taken.
Neither can three or more stones.
There cannot be any gaps.
One of the end stones must be placed last to trigger the capture.
Two or more pairs *can* be taken simultaneously.

In the standard and tournament versions, a game can be won by capturing five pairs of stones.
Note that in the "Five in a Row" variant, captures do not cause a win.

Once the game is over, it is often worth reviewing the game to see how you can improve.
