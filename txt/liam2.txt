Great :)

Well I wasn't exactly spectacularly successful with Indie music ;)

Interesting. I'll aim for quite a few features for the first release and leave some easy ones for several later releases then. lol

More lols :)

Cool.

Great. I first started using it around 1998 for simple scripting. It took me a few years before I really started to use it for larger projects.

I've met Richard Jones a few times at the Melbourne Python User's Group around 10 years ago. As you know, he's brilliant. I particularly remember a presentation that he gave using his own presentation tool that he wrote in Python. I think he called it "Bruce" (LOL - definitely not related) Yeah, here it is:

He seemed to touch type python so accurately at warp speed. It was just adding a letter from a recorded script every time he pressed any key. LOL ;D

Interesting. I've never even heard of Haxe, though I've been out of the loop for the last nearly 5 years. I haven't had anything to do with mobile devices before, and don't know all that much about web programming (no Flash, minimal JS).

Another problem with Kivy that I presume Haxe doesn't have is the size of the delivery packages - they are huge for "Hello World" with Kivy. You can trim it down (or so I'm told) but it takes time and effort.

> I still fall back to Python to pseudocode and test out ideas, though.

I'm not keen to learn anything else at the moment - there's still LOTS for me to learn in the Python world, and I can get most things done with it.

That reminds me of another complaint I have Kivy/Python:
multithreading / multiprocessing on iOS (and Android too I believe)
My search algorithm is very CPU intensive, so I first split it into a separate python thread. That allowed the GUI and search to run in parallel. However the GUI lag was pretty horrible when the search was running. I realised that the python Global Interpreter Lock was preventing multiple hardware processors from being of any use. Later, I changed to using a separate process for the search in order to reduce the GUI lag. That helped a huge amount on OSX. But when I reached iOS, I discovered that multiprocessing is crippled on iOS. Oh goody. Incidentally, have you used iOS' "multitasking"? I'm currently back to using multithreading and just wearing the lag (yuck).

More tools that I've never heard of :)
The Kivy team uses a tool called "cython" to convert python and python-like code to c for time critical code. (.pyx is like .py except with type safety) I'm using it (barely) for a lot of my search code, with good enough results for now. The pain has been getting the cythonised code on to my iPad - Kivy doesn't yet provide an easy way of doing this.

Shall do. I've just got my app onto my iPad again. I'd be happy to send you a copy if that is possible and you're interested.

Thanks again,
