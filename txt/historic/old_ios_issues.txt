2 pyx files are causing problems with iOS
On OS X they work fine as pyx (or py)
utility_stats.py[x] and ab_state.py[x]

There are 2 issues:
1. What is wrong with them?
2. How do I clean the kivy-ios and/or XCode data so that it runs again after switching from .pyx to .py?

Both issues show the same symptom when the app is run from XCode:
  File "/Users/cropleyb/kivy-ios/app-pentair/YourApp/pentai/ai/ab_state.py", line 7, in <module>
  File "<string>", line 32, in load_module
   ImportError: dynamic module does not define init function (initutility_stats)
   2014-04-12 16:23:18.557 pentair[7114:60b] Application quit abnormally!
   2014-04-12 16:23:18.579 pentair[7114:60b] Leaving

Other modules in the same package work fine cythonized.
This error message is usually caused by a corrupt (or missing?) .so file.
For 2., where is this? I've cleaned the entire kivy-ios directory of utility_stats.* files, and forced a rebuild of libpentai.a
The build/test cycle is very slow. If problem 2. could be solved then this could be improved.
app-pentai/YourApp/build seem to be identical

Qs:
- diff the app directories
  Small differences in templates? Doesn't seem different enough?
- it can't be libpentai.a as that is the same for both working & failing.
- Does creating a new "app-pentai" project fix the second problem?
  Yes: At least that is faster than creating a new kivy-ios.
  # No:  Either there is something being cached in kivy-ios, or XCode, or something is still broken in the pentai source.
- Is there another file under kivy-ios that is caching the old utility_stats extension? Or is it XCode that is doing dodgy caching?
- What else is going into the XCode project besides libpentai.a (if anything)
  kivy-ios/app-pentair; lots of other static libs

Try:
Create a new project, with an empty utility_stats.pyx, use binary search to find what is causing it to fail.
