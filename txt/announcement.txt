Hi all.

I am in the process of writing an app for playing Pente against an AI player. It plays fairly well on my computer (beats me more times than not), but it would play much better if it had a better openings book.
Does anyone have an openings book from top players, or games between top players that they would be willing to share? Ideally in a text format for easy processing?

At the moment, it is just for playing against the AI, but an interface to pente.org and/or other sites would also be possible.

Having seen the great discussion on http://pente.org/gameServer/forums/thread.jspa?forumID=1&threadID=4653, I have a few comments regarding PentAI:

- Most of the techniques I have used are standard AI.
- There is no difference in how it plays as P1 and P2
- There is no explicit knowledge of the opponent's ability yet, and each game is currently automatically added to the openings DB.
- It's not infallible yet, but it beats me most games on depth 6, and makes a move in around a minute on depth 10.
- "Adzi" is not explicitly coded for, but may possibly be played if the utility function and search depth are sufficient.
- Symmetry is only exploited in the openings book, not in the transposition table (used for equivalent positions due to move ordering)
- translational symmetry is not yet used

If you are interested in how it is implemented, take a look at http://bruce-cropley.com/pentai

Thanks, and happy pente playing,
Bruce :)
