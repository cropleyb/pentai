Hi Liam

Thank you VERY much for all that information, much appreciated :)

I've only read it once so far, but it has got me thinking.
I was attempting to sell my music independently for a bit, with negligible success, and my impression from what you've written is that the games industry is similarly hard to crack for individuals. I have tried several music websites (SoundCloud, ReverbNation, Live365, Radio Airplay etc.), and read some books on music marketing. So I think I get basics of what is involved.
ReverbNation offers "Press Kit" functionality for a fee, which I have tried, so I could adapt that idea to my game.
I can't easily get around to meet up with lots of people for networking. OTOH, I do have lots of time to improve my app and do online networking. I think I'll delay releasing for a while, until I've refined it a great deal and added in the features that people actually want.
The guff on my web page is currently aimed at developers and people who ask "how does it work?" If I do decide to sell it someday then I will change the web page, and probably remove that content entirely.

My step-mum Marina has told me a story about a disabled friend of hers who has been hassled by the government about her disability pension; that has me seriously freaked about my disability insurance - if they realise I can still code, they might assume that I can work, and that would stress me enormously and probably kill me fairly quickly.

If you ever want to bounce some ideas off me then go for it. I'll send you a copy of my game if you like. (when I get it onto iOS again) Do you code in Python? I'm happy to discuss Kivy or whatever.

Thank you very much again for your time. 
Bruce :)
