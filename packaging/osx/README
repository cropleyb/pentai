Copy the two hooks files into the directory: pyinstaller/PyInstaller/hooks
pai.spec is an example of the spec file that you will need to create and alter, as per the Kivy OS X packaging instructions.

It includes alterations for adding the media directory:
   Tree('/Users/cropleyb/Dropbox/pente/media', prefix="media"),

And for adding the kv file
   a.datas + (("pentai/gui/pentai.kv", '/Users/cropleyb/Dropbox/pente/pentai/gui/pentai.kv', 'DATA'),),
